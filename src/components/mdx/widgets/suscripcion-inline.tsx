/**
 * Subscription ask placed inside the article body.
 *
 * In the body on purpose, not in the sticky rail and not only at the foot: a
 * reader who is halfway through and finding it useful is the one most likely to
 * want the next one. Before this, six of the nine published articles — every
 * lesson — had no email field anywhere on the page, including the one hosting the
 * cost calculator.
 *
 * The copy comes from the post's frontmatter, resolved in page.tsx (the MDX body
 * cannot see its own frontmatter, so the component is bound to the post where
 * the components map is built). One typed field, like everywhere else.
 *
 * When the post declares a `recurso`, this form *is* the delivery. Before that,
 * an article with a downloadable attached asked twice: a subscribe box in the
 * body and a link out to /recursos, which is the same signup into the same
 * list — so it read as being asked for an address over and over. `signup_path`
 * still separates the two places, so nothing is lost by merging the ask.
 *
 * `not-prose` because it sits inside Prose and should not inherit article
 * typography.
