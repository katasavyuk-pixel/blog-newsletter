 * Placeholder substitution for the markdown-authored sequence emails.

 * TypeScript. But the first email has to say the reader's own numbers back to
 * them, and markdown cannot do that. Rather than reach for a templating engine,
 * a fixed, documented set of `{{names}}` gets replaced with pre-rendered HTML.
 *
 * The strict part matters: an unknown or misspelled placeholder **throws**. The
 * alternative is shipping a literal `{{desglse}}` to every subscriber, and there
 * is no way to unsend that. Callers catch the error and skip the step, so a typo
 * costs one missing email rather than a visibly broken one.

 * is to refuse to send a body whose braces did not resolve, whatever is inside.

 * `href="%7B%7Burl_sitio%7D%7D/empieza-aqui"`. Nothing downstream matched that:
 * the substitution regex looked for literal braces and found none, and — worse —
 * neither did the leftover guard, so the email rendered "cleanly" and went out
 * with every CTA pointing at a path that does not exist.
 *
 * It shipped that way from 2026-07-29 until 2026-08-21. Two of the three welcome
 * emails no longer contained a single literal `{{` by the time it was found,
 * which is why nothing looked wrong: an email with dead buttons and an email with
 * working ones are byte-identical to the eye.
 *
 * Normalising here rather than at each call site keeps it to one place, and means
 * the guard above sees the placeholder again — a `{{typo}}` inside a link now
 * throws like it always should have.
