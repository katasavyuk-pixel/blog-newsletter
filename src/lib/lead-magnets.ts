/**
 * Lead magnet submissions — what a reader produced, kept so the first onboarding
 * email can hand it back.
 *
 * The rule this file exists to enforce: **the payload is recomputed on the
 * server**, never stored as the browser sent it. The welcome email quotes these
 * figures, and a quoted figure is a claim. Accepting client-supplied numbers
 * would let anyone put any price in an email that carries this site's name.
 *
 * Everything here is best-effort. A failure to record a submission must never
 * be the reason a subscription fails — same posture as the onboarding sequence.
